üìå Project Overview: K-Means Clustering on College Data
1Ô∏è‚É£ Objective:
The goal is to group colleges into distinct clusters based on various features (e.g., tuition, graduation rate, student population).

This helps in understanding similarities between colleges.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset: College.csv
The dataset contains details about different colleges, possibly including:

Private: Whether the college is private or public.

Room.Board: Room and board costs.

Grad.Rate: Graduation rate percentage.

Outstate: Out-of-state tuition.

Other factors: Enrollment, acceptance rate, etc.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Techniques Used:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling numeric features.

K-Means Clustering: Applying the algorithm to group similar colleges.

Visualization: Using Seaborn & Matplotlib to plot results.

Evaluation: Checking cluster validity (Elbow method, Silhouette score).

It is unsupervised learning algorithm
